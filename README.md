# flutter_demo

A new Flutter programming dojo to learn fundamental concepts.

## Before you start

Before starting this demo, please complete the following codelab to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts of the development environment, the language, and the installation process.
Your first Flutter app: available in https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first?hl=es-419#0

## Getting Started

Programming graphical user interfaces (Views) using the Dart language and its Flutter framework is a simple process, with a relatively low learning curve and a wide variety of components available for use, as already provided in Google's official documentation. 

This demo illustrates the creation of a basic app that utilizes a single page on to keep the menu consistently visible on the left side of the application, and a container on the right where the content will be displayed according to the selected menu option. This application creates users and queries them through a REST API exposed in AWS. The project structure utilizes the Business Logic Component (BLoC) design pattern straightforwardly and intuitively for initial use. Ideal for teams taking their first steps with Flutter.
